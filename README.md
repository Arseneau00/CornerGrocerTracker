# Corner Grocer – Item Frequency Tracker (CS 210 Project Three)

This project was built for CS 210. The goal was to create a C++ program that reads a list of grocery items from a text file and counts how many times each item was purchased. It helps track item frequency and presents the results in multiple ways, like a histogram. This was a great way to tie together what I’ve learned about file input/output, loops, maps, and writing clean, organized code.


## Project Files

- `main.cpp` – Main source file
- `cs210_project_three_input_file.txt` – Input file with sample grocery items
- `frequency.dat` – Output file generated by the program


## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure the input file is in the same directory.
2. Open `main.cpp` in Visual Studio or your preferred compiler.
3. Build and run the program.
4. Use the menu to view all item frequencies, search for a specific item, display a histogram, or exit.


## Reflection

### What problem did this project solve?
It solves the problem of tracking purchase frequency in a grocery store. The program reads a list of purchased items and shows how often each one appears. This kind of tool could help stores make better inventory and sales decisions.

### What did I do particularly well?
I think I did a good job organizing the program into clean, readable code with good formatting and comments. I also liked how the histogram came out—it adds a nice visual touch to the output.

### Where could I enhance my code?
I’d improve error handling, especially if the input file is missing or empty. I’d also consider making the program loop until the user decides to quit, so you don’t have to restart it every time. These changes would make the program more user-friendly and reliable.

### What did I find most challenging, and how did I overcome it?
Working with file input/output and counting word frequency with a map was a little tricky at first. I had to look up how maps work in C++, and I tested a lot of small parts before putting it all together. Once I got the logic down, it started to click.

### What transferable skills did I build from this?
This helped me practice core programming skills that I’ll use again, like handling files, working with loops and conditionals, using classes and functions to keep things organized, and writing readable, maintainable code. These are definitely going to help in future classes and projects.

### How did I make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used clear variable names, added comments, and broke things into logical sections. If I or someone else wanted to add features later—like sorting or exporting to CSV—it would be easy to do without rewriting everything.
